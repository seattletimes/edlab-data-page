When the global coronavirus pandemic first emerged in early 2020 (or late 2019?) and forced the shutdown in schools across the nation, most experts assumed that the pause in in-person learning would be over in a few weeks. Instead, it took many months before children returned to the classroom — and in the Seattle region, it took more than a year. Teachers and districts scrambled to put together online learning, often with little or no training on what works best.

What happened to children during that year of virtual schooling? Educators still don’t have a good measure of how they fared academically, because standardized testing and even screening tools to measure specific skills, like reading comprehension, were suspended. But evidence suggests that, compared to what their predecessors learned in prior years, <a href=”https://www.crpe.org/sites/default/files/final_academic_impacts_report_2021_crpe.pdf” target=”_blank” rel=”noopener nofollow”> students lagged academic expectations by several months</a>, and that there were sharp increases in the number of students who failed courses, especially among students from low-income households and students of color.

Many students, especially those from low-income households, struggled with internet access, impeding their ability to attend virtual school. Many working-class parents weren’t able to work from home, leaving children with a patchwork of care situations and sometimes risking their lives to work. Thousands of homeless children in Washington disappeared from school enrollment counts, even as homelessness was on the increase around the Puget Sound area. The pandemic was especially hard on children with learning disabilities, and some districts — like Seattle — were called out by the state superintendent’s office for poor support of those students.
